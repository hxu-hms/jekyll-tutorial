## Publication and Data Landing pages

Stand-alone websites may not be necessary for some projects. For these instances, your research may be showcased as a publication or data landing page on the [LSP website](http://labsyspharm.org) or the [Harvard Tissue Atlas website](http://tissue-atlas.org).

The template for these landing pages serves as a checklist for files and information to provide in order for your research to be properly represented.

Publication/data landing page template can be found under the DropBox folder `HiTS/Website Files/Publication Pages`
