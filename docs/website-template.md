# Website Templates

Two website templates are available for LSP lab members - a **software** website and a **method** website. 

> *\*For projects that does not involve software or method sharing, please reference [template](./website-template.md#publication-and-data-landing-pages) for publication and data landing pages.*

Each template outlines the recommended documentation for your project, organized into a logical navigation structure. Comments and suggested formatting can be found throughout the template to guide the website making process.

Make sure to start with [Tutorial](https://labsyspharm.github.io/jekyll-tutorial/tutorial) for step-by-step instructions to use these template.

## Publication and Data Landing pages

Stand-alone websites may not be necessary for some projects. For these instances, your research may be showcased as a publication or data landing page on the [LSP website](http://labsyspharm.org) or the [Harvard Tissue Atlas website](http://tissue-atlas.org).

The template for these landing pages serves as a checklist for files and information to provide in order for your research to be properly represented.

Publication/data landing page template can be found on the [HiTS SharePoint](https://hu.sharepoint.com/sites/HiTS/SitePages/Research-Websites.aspx){:target="_blank"}.

> *\*if you have questions about the landing page template, please reach out to Juliann Tefft (Juliann_Tefft at hms.harvard.edu)*

## datarelease-README.md in the website templates

The `datarelease-README.md` is applicable to the projects that involve data or code release, in addition to having a dedicated Jekyll site. It is designed as a guide for users to access the released data or code easily, in a list format. 

If you need to use the `datarelease-README.md`, follow these three simple steps

1. Edit `datarelease-README.md` to reflect the data you need to release
2. Delete `README.md`
3. Rename `datarelease-README.md` to `README.md`. This will display its contents at below the list of files in your repository
