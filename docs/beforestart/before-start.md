# Data Management

For LSP members, head to the [Data Management](https://hu.sharepoint.com/sites/HiTS/SitePages/Tidy-Data.aspx) page on our SharePoint for more Harvard and LSP specific information.

Having a well managed dataset is the foundation of your website. Here are a few points to consider **before** you start building your website:
* Know where your data is
* Know who has access to view your data
    * And who *should* have access to view your data once it's published
    * Know what types of access they *should not* have. E.g. deletion, editing etc.
* Is your data well-named and organized for a public audience (this audience likely includes your reviewers!)?
* If dataset contains unpublished data, make sure you know which parts your website will be linking to

# GitHub account setup

1. Head to [GitHub](github.com) and choose **Sign Up** on the upper right corner
2. Follow the prompt to set up your account. Ideally, use an email address that you will be frequently checking, since notifications regarding your website will be emailed to you. (It does not have to be your hms email)
3. Confirm your email address via the emailed link
4. Once your account is fully set up, contact Jeremy(link to email?) to be added to the **Laboratoy of Systems Pharmacology @ Harvard** group and obtain permission to make repositories under this group
