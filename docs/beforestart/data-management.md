# Data management

For LSP members, head to the [Data Management](https://hu.sharepoint.com/sites/HiTS/SitePages/Tidy-Data.aspx) page on our SharePoint for more Harvard and LSP specific information.

Having a well managed dataset is the foundation of your website. Here are a few points to consider **before** you start building your website:
* Know where your data is
* Know who has access to view your data
    * And who *should* have access to view your data once it's published
    * Know what types of access they *should not* have. E.g. deletion, editing etc.
* Is your data well-named and organized for a public audience (this audience likely includes your reviewers!)?
* If dataset contains unpublished data, make sure you know which parts your website will be linking to
