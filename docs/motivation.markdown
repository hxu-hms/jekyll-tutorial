# Why would I make a website?

![open science](./images/open-science-logo-2.jpg)

Open science is the movement to make scientific research and data accessible to all. Open science campaigns for open-access publicatons, archieves and data repositories. Making a public-facing website to showcase your research is one of the best ways to participate in the open science movement.

> (Making a website) It's a relatively small investment of time that can pay off in terms of career progress, giving researchers greater control over how their expertise is presented online. It can also help researchers attract PhD students, share resources with the scientific community and promote their work to the general public.

# Why should I use Jekyll?

That's a fair question! Jekyll as a website design and build tool has a number of things going for it. A main advantage is that Jekyll is a _static_ website generator, which means that instead of relying on software and databases running on a server, it only need a directoyr of files on your computer. This means that there are fewer components to create and maintain. This simplicity also means that it presents your website faster to the viewers and it's more stable than a dynamic website. 

## Integration with Git and GitHub Pages

Additionally, because Jekyll webiste is a directory of files, you can store your entire website on a Git repository (like [GitHub](https://github.com)). Working in a Git repository gives you [many benefits](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/why-git) including version control and easy collaboration. 

GitHub will also host your Jekyll website for free in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! You can even do most of your editing on GitHub and have no need to install any additional software on your computer if you choose to take the [import template](./import-template) route described in this tutorial. 

## Some downsides and how we can help

Of course, nothing is without its drawbacks. Working with Jekyll has some downsides as well. In this tutorial, we try to mitigate some of the less ideal parts of working with Jekyll for you. 

- Jekyll does not have a built-in GUI.
  
  Jekyll is a command-line tool, which could seem overwelming to non-technical users. Using the LSP template eliminates a lot of the need to use Jekyll command lines, but if you are new to formatting languages like Markdown and YAML, it can still be disorienting. We recommend checking out our pages on [Markdown](./markdown-basic) and [YAML](./yaml) basics that are most useful while building a Jekyll website. There are additional learning resources linked in those pages as well, if you want to learn more about these languages.
  
- Jekyll has relatively few themes

  Jekyll has a growing number of publicly available themes, but not all of them are designed for an academic website. For LSP members, we have a theme tailor made for showcasing your research. You can choose between a _software tool_ based template or a _publication_ based template. Check out our page on themes to find out more.

- Jekyll has a smaller community to offer support (than WordPress for example)

  Fear not! In our [Get Help](./help) page, you can find ways to contact people within LSP that can offer you technical support when you need them.
