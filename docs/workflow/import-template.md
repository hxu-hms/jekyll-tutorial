# Setting up a GitHub account

To start off, since your website will be hosted by GitHub, you need a [personal GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#personal-user-accounts). 

If you do not have one right now, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for one. Make sure this account is associated with an email that you check regularly. 

If you are a member of the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, please contact Jeremy to be invited to join the LSP group on GitHub.

# Adding and edting pages on GitHub

Adding and editing pages can be achieved by adding and editing Markdown files in the website repository. Each Markdown file corresponds to a page in the final website. This tutorial website includes some [Markdown basic syntax](./markdown-basic) to get you started.

# Setting up GitHub pages

After you are happy with your site, you can set it up to be displayed:
1. Make sure your repository access is set to **public**. This can be changed under Settings > Manage access.
2. Within Settings, head over to Pages and change the default Source to the branch and folder where your website files are stored.
3. Click "Save" after configruing the source. A banner should show up to show that your website is "Your site is ready to be published at *url*" and eventually "your site is published at *url*".

Now, if you head to the displayed *url*, you should see your finished website.
