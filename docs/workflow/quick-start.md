# Quick Start

There are two ways to start your Jekyll website. You can either edit and preview your website completely on GitHub, or download your files to your computer and work with them locally. 

{: .fw-300 }
Here we present both options.

## Importing Website Template on GitHub

1. [Import](https://github.com/new/import){:target="_blank"} the website template. Set **Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology @ Harvard** (labsyspharm) as owner.
2. Fill the template with your own content. For details, refer to instructions on how to [add](./import-template.md#adding-pages-on-github) and [edit](./import-template.md#editing-pages-on-github) pages on GitHub.
3. [Set up](./import-template#setting-up-github-pages) GitHub Pages to make your website public

## Working with Jekyll locally

1. Check your system for prerequisit programs and [install](./local-setup.md#installing-jekyll) Jekyll following documentation
2. Start [building](./local-setup.md#setting-up-a-website-to-be-hosted-on-github) your Jekyll site locally using the custom template
3. [Test](./local-setup.md#testing-site-locally) your site locally
